    <p1>
        I am a self taught developer, and have gained experience with open source learning materials
        as well as paid courses. However, I have gained the most experience from working on my own projects, such as this website and also the other projects on my Github. Please find the
        link below to my Github page, in the blue box! <br /><br />
        I started out learning Javascript, HTML and CSS before moving onto learning Python and PostgreSQL.
        The next language I am working on is C#. I have completed courses on Udemy, such as:
    </p1>

    <ul>
        <li>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</li>
        <li>Complete PostgreSQL bootcamp 2022</li>
        <li>C# Masterclass (In progress)</li>
    </ul>

                    I have completed the 'Automate the Boring Stuff with Python' course on Udemy. I enjoy writing in Python and am comfortable with
                    functions, dataframes and module useage. I have created an investment analysis project using Python and PostgreSQL which is available on my Github account.

                    <p2> I enjoy using JavaScript and would like to gain more experience with it. This website uses Javascript to add interactivity, such as this fade in effect!
                         Other projects used are the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' repo on my Github, and the Language Learning Application too. The latter of these is designed using Node.Js and the React framework.

                    <p5> For the best example of using PostgreSQL, please look for the financial analysis application on my Github. I have completed a Udemy course
                         on PostgreSQL and understand how to set this up with PgAdmin. I can comfortable use this, in conjunction with other technologies such as Python,
                         to add and retrieve data from databases, as well as navigate the database using SQL.</p5>

            <h3> What I am doing now </h3>

            <p2>
                I am currently working in Building Services Engineering, as an Electrical Engineering Technician and have completed
                an HND in this part time whilst studying.
                I have learned skills such as:
            </p2>
            <ul>
                <li>Electrical Services Design (including LV Distribution, Lighting designs, Fire Alarm designs and more)</li>
                <li>AutoCAD Proficiency</li>
                <li>Site Surveying</li>
                <li>Minute taking</li>
                <li>Chairing Meetings</li>
                <li>Coordinating Services</li>
                <li>Communicating with external project members</li>
                <li>Managing project requirements</li>
                <li>Report Writing</li>
            </ul>




            <h3> What I would like to be doing </h3>

            <p2>
                I am studying programming in my free time to facilitate a career change into Software Development.
                at this point, my goal is to progress into a role as a full stack developer in a software consultancy company as I have prior experience
                within consultancy work. At first, I seemed to prefer backend development, as my main interests were how things worked 'under the hood'.
                However, as I have learnt more about the industry and seen how things work, I have definitely gained an appreciation for front end development,
                and find both parts equally satisying at this point. Whilst learning about how programs run and interact with each other, I have gained an interest
                in the principles of how computers work. For example, working on projects which involved declaring ports for a PostgreSQL database and Python program
                to interact, introduced me to how deeply you can dive into learning in this industry - a strong reason which led me to this career change. Another example
                of this is the setup of a secure connection to access email accounts, and the communication protocols required.
                <br /><br /> Of course I understand that I do not fully understand the industry and I am sure that as I learn more and gain employment within relevant roles
                that my goals will change, however slightly. Overall I am very excited for the future and to learn more!
